        <p>is the branch of dentistry that treats and corrects malocclusion or a bad bite. A malocclusion is the misalignment or incorrect relationship of the jaws and teeth.</p>
        <h3>Types of Braces</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Traditional Braces</p></li>
            <p>Traditional braces are the typical metal braces that most people associate orthodontic braces with. Metal braces are made from high-grade stainless steel that do not rust. They are very strong and durable.The metal brackets are attached to each tooth and linked to each other with a thin wire. Tiny elastic bands called ligatures attaches the wire to the brackets. The wire exerts gentle pressure on the teeth and moves them slowly into their correct position or alignment.This type of braces requires periodic adjustment, tightening and replacement of wires and ligatures.</p>
            <li><p>Ceramic Braces</p></li>
            <p>The brackets of ceramic braces have the same size and shape as traditional braces. They also function in the same way as metallic braces in aligning teeth. However, unlike traditional braces, ceramic braces are not made of metal. They are made of either tooth-colored or clear and transparent ceramic materials.Ceramic braces are less obvious and visible compared to metallic braces. This makes ceramic braces a popular choice for people who donâ€™t want their braces to be obvious.Like traditional braces, ceramic braces require periodic visits to the dentist for adjustments and replacements of wires and ligatures.</p>
            <li><p>Clear Aligners</p></li>
            <p>Clear aligners work the same way as traditional braces do. They are both orthodontic appliances used to move and align teeth. However, unlike traditional braces, clear aligners are not made of metal or ceramic. They are made of a special, clear and flexible plastic that are completely removable.Clear aligners are mouth trays that are customized to align your teeth slowly over a period of time. Special software is used to design a plan to move your teeth from their current position to their desired position or alignment. They are designed in a series and must be worn one set after another until the desired results are achievedWhile clear aligners can correct a lot of malocclusions, there will still be cases that are better corrected with traditional braces. To know if you are a candidate for clear aligners, please visit us for a consultation.</p>
