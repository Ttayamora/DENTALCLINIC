        <p>Oral Surgery focuses on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of diseases, injuries and defects of both the hard and soft tissues of the mouth and teeth.

            Surgical procedures in our clinics are conducted in a safe and sterile environment and performed by a team of highly qualified, trained and experienced oral surgeons.</p>
            <h2>Among the most common oral surgical procedures we provide are:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Tooth Extraction</p></li>
                <p>A tooth extraction or dental extraction is a simple procedure involving the removal of teeth from the socket in the alveolar bone. The procedure is relatively straightforward and can be quickly performed using local anesthesia.There are a number of reasons why the extraction of a tooth may be needed.</p>
                <li><p>Wisdom Teeth Extraction</p></li>
                <p>Wisdom teeth or your “third molars” are the last molars to erupt on each side of your upper and lower jaws. They normally erupt during the late teens or early twenties.When wisdom teeth emerges from the gum line and the jaw is large enough to accommodate them, they erupt normally and may not cause you pain or problems. But, most of the time, one or more of these third molars do not emerge properly. Third molars that fail to emerge fully through the gum line are called “impacted wisdom teeth.” An impacted wisdom tooth means the third molar is “impacted” between the jawbone and the gum tissue.Wisdom tooth extraction is a surgical procedure to remove one or more wisdom teeth. Dentists recommend the surgical removal of impacted wisdom teeth to avoid problems in the future.Impacted wisdom teeth can result in swelling, pain and infection. It can also cause permanent damage to nearby teeth, gums, and bone. Sometimes, impacted wisdom teeth can also lead to the formation of cysts or tumors that can destroy sections of the jaw.</p>
                <li><p>Dental Implants</p></li>
                <p>If you have missing teeth but don’t like the idea of wearing dentures or a dental bridge then having a dental implant might be right for you. Dental implants are the best long-term solution to replace missing teeth.A dental implant procedure involves the surgical placement of an artificial tooth root or post (made of titanium or ceramic) into the jaw. Over time, the bone grows and attaches itself directly to the implant.Once the implant has successfully integrated to the bone, an abutment to hold the replacement tooth (dental crown) is installed. If you have several missing teeth, dental implants can also be used to hold implant supported bridges and dentures.If you have missing teeth, dental implants can drastically improve the quality of your life by giving you the ability to eat and the confidence to smile. Dental implants look, feel and function just like your real teeth.</p>
